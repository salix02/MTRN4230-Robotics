% ALL X AND Y ARE IN GLOBAL COORDINATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
% on_table is all the reachable blocks on the table
%   [x, y, angle, color, shape]

% not_inside_grid is the blocks on the table not board or deck and reachable
%   [x, y, angle, color, shape]

% msgPos is the desired global goal
% if clicked inside deck or board, it will give centre of the cell
% otherwise, it just returns the clicked global coordinate
%   [x,y,z]

% when click on the figure, the msgPos will be displayed
% when click on the figure, cell number will be displayed for both deck and board
% parameters for converting local to global need to be confirmed with Alvin

% functions for questions, messages are prepared, need to send packed data
% and unpack received data
% functions for each questions could be executed in main loop by checking
