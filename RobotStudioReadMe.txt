The station set up is as per suggested with IOs mentioned in the forum post titled "[OFFICIAL] Robotstudio Setup and sample code". 
On top of this however, an extra system output is used with a signal called
"MOV" with properties copied from DO10_1. This is connected with the robot parameter "Mechanical Unit Not Moving" for its output.

3 tasks have been used in RobotStudio. 2 Communication tasks and a single robot movement task.
